## Content Rules
- Hero copy must state: audience + business/technical outcome.
- Section titles must be action/outcome-focused, not generic marketing labels.
- One page = one primary CTA, with up to two secondary CTAs.
- Each page should include at least one trust element (proof, process, partner, or governance).
- Keep Thai as primary copy with selective English terms only where domain-specific.
